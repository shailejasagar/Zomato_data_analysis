# Zomato_data_analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset from Zomato, a popular restaurant discovery platform, using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to answer key questions related to restaurant types, customer ratings, and spending patterns. The dataset used in this project contains restaurant information such as location, type, customer ratings, votes, and cost for two people.

Key Questions Addressed:
Which type of restaurant do most customers typically order from?
Which type of restaurant has the most number of votes?
What are the ratings that most restaurants have earned?
What is the average cost of spending for two people?
Which mode (e.g., online ordering, dine-in) receives the maximum rating?

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the Zomato dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of different restaurant attributes such as votes, ratings, and cost.
Insights and Findings: Answering the specific questions with data visualizations and analysis.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about various restaurants, including:
Restaurant name
Type (e.g., Casual Dining, Quick Bites, Fine Dining, etc.)
Rating
Number of votes
Average cost for two people
Mode of operation (e.g., Delivery, Dine-in, Takeaway)

Libraries Used
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Seaborn: Advanced statistical plots.
Numpy: Handling numerical data.

Steps in the Analysis
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the relationships between variables, identifying trends, and visualizing distributions.

Answering Key Questions:
Restaurant Types: Determining the most popular restaurant types based on customer orders.
Vote Analysis: Identifying which restaurant types receive the most votes.
Ratings: Analyzing the ratings distribution and identifying the most common ratings.
Cost for Two People: Calculating the average cost for two people and analyzing spending trends.
Mode Analysis: Determining which modes (delivery, dine-in, etc.) receive the highest ratings.

Insights and Findings
Restaurant Type Popularity: After analyzing the data, we identified the most ordered restaurant types based on the number of orders.
Votes Analysis: The type of restaurant with the highest number of votes was determined, revealing customer engagement with certain restaurant categories.
Ratings Analysis: Most restaurants tend to receive a specific range of ratings, which can be used to understand customer satisfaction trends.
Average Spending: The average spending for two people was calculated, providing insights into consumer behavior and pricing.
Mode Rating: We analyzed which service mode (delivery, dine-in, etc.) receives the highest customer ratings.

Conclusion: 
The analysis of the Zomato dataset provides valuable insights into customer behavior, restaurant ratings, and spending patterns. These findings can help restaurant owners make data-driven decisions regarding their offerings, pricing, and marketing strategies.
